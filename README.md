I have created an  E-commerce application using Flutter and Dart that includes a splash screen, login and signup pages, a home page, and a cart screen. I used GetX for state management and Hive for local storage. I implemented cart functionality and a login feature.

 I followed the instructions as best as possible, but unfortunately, I was unable to add Firebase Authentication due to time constraints. If allowed additional time, I am confident that I can complete this feature. In the meantime, I have set up a static login with the following credentials:# coral_interview
